    <h2> /KNOW ME BETTER:</h2>
    <p>After graduating in <strong>Gastronomy</strong>, I discovered my aptitude in <strong>management</strong> So, in 2012, I decided to deepen my knowledge with a degree in Business Administration, aiming to become a manager in the gastronomic area. 
        However, during the course, I had the opportunity to do an internship at PUCRS, being hired in the administrative area for a short period of time.<br> In this experience, I understood the Market better, adjusting my focus to postgraduate courses in the administrative area, as they are more objective and directed to my needs.<br>
        After 11 years of experience in the financial field, I decided to challenge myself and change my professional area again. <strong>I started my studies in programming and <em>web development</em> to prepare myself to a new journey toward immigration to Canada.</strong><br> I'm 35 years old, i live in Brazil, specifically in the city of Porto Alegre, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
