    <h2> /KNOW ME BETTER:</h2>
    <p><strong>I'm 35 years old, i live in Brazil, specifically in the city of Porto Alegre, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</strong></p>
    <p>After graduating in Gastronomy, I discovered my aptitude in management So, in 2012, I decided to deepen my knowledge with a degree in Business Administration, aiming to become a manager in the gastronomic area. However, during the course, I had the opportunity to do an internship at PUCRS, being hired in the administrative area for a short period of time.
        In this experience, I understood the Market better, adjusting my focus to postgraduate courses in the administrative area, as they are more objective and directed to my needs.
        After 11 years of experience in the financial field, I decided to challenge myself and change my professional area again. I started my studies in programming and web development to prepare myself to a new journey toward immigration to Canada.</p>
